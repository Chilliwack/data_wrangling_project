# data_wrangling_project

**data_wrangling_project** is an effort conducted to combine various data elements into one analysis. The goal of this analysis is to:

1. Gather data from web scrapping, structured files, and APIs
2. Assess the collected data for quality or tidiness issues
3. Clean the data
4. Store, analyze, and visualize the data
5. Report out on data wrangling, analyses and visualization efforts.

This project was done as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program.
